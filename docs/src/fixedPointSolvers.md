# Fixed Point Solvers

Methods and Interface for building solvers for the quadratic team decision problem using empirical methods.

## Explanation

The solution to the static quadratic team decision problem is entirely characterized by a set of linear operator equations over the (product) policy space.
These are called the **Stationarity Equations**, and for all ``i \in  \{1, \dots, N\}`` they read

```math
\mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbf{Q}_{ii} \vert \mathbf{Y}_i \right]\gamma^i(\mathbf{Y}_i) + \sum_{i,j=1  , j \neq i} \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbf{Q}_{ij}  \gamma_{(k)}^j \left( \mathbf{Y}_j \right) \vert \mathbf{Y}_i \right] + \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbf{R}_i \vert \mathbf{Y}_i \right] = 0 \text{ a.s.}.
```

We can write these compactly as

```math
\mathbf{A}\gamma = - \tilde{\mathbf{R}}.
```

Write

```math
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}_1 + \mathbf{A}_2
```

with easily invertible ``\mathbf{A}_1``, and consider the iteration

```math
\gamma_{k+1} = -\mathbf{A}_1^{-1}\left( \mathbf{A}_2\gamma_{k} + \tilde{\mathbf{R}} \right)
```

which is a fixed point iteration. This iteration is generated by the **operator splitting** ``\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}_1 + \mathbf{A}_2``. For this reason, we dub the methods implemented in this library **operator splitting methods**, which, given our problem structure, are entirely identical to their finite dimensional matric analogues.

For more details on this class of operator splittings, please see [gauss-seidel](@cite).

## Convergence Behavior

The convergence behavior of the methods implemented in this library depends upon the eigenvalues of the system matrix ``\mathbf{Q}``. In particular, the assumption that ``\mathbf{Q}`` is bounded away from zero implies that the decomposition

```math
\mathbf{Q} =  \mathbf{T} + \lambda_{\mathrm{min}}I,
```

for positive semidefinite ``\mathbf{T}`` is always valid.

The convergence of our schemes then depends upon the quantitoes``\varrho(\mathbf{T})`` and ``\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}``. Note that ``\varrho(\mathbf{T})`` exists and is finite as, by assumption, ``\mathbf{Q}`` is uniformly bounded above.
